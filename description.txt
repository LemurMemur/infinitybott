Infinite Buffs
Works similarly to Luiafk; Buffs automatically apply directly when in inventory. They do not need to be equiped and do not take up any buff slots.
Keybinds are needed for Recall, Return, Teleportation, Peace, and War.
For Peace and War, the highest level of modifier will be used; The candle and potion modifiers will be additive, while the ultimate modifier is fixed.
Suggested use with AlchemistNPC, Fargo's Souls, and Recipe Browser


It will usually take 30 of an item to create the infinite potion buff item, rarer items and furniture buffs (Like campfire) will usually take 5 to craft, and even rarer items (Ammo Box, Bast Statue, etc.) take 2.
Most items with multiple crafting versions will require the default version until I finish a good portion of the mod and then figure out how to use recipe groups.
(use basic woodeen campfire, etc.)
Some materials (prime example is bast statue) will most likely require crate fishing.

WARNING:
Calamity Mod has some speed changes not reflected in this mod, due to its base movement speed buff from 15 mps -> 23 mps.
Swiftness potions were nerfed in Calamity to give a 15% speed bonus instead of 25%.
Well Fed speed bonuses decreased from:
20% -> 5%
30% -> 7.5%
40% -> 10%
for Well Fed, Plenty Satisfied, and Exquisitely Stuffed, respectively.
!!! THESE CHANGES ARE NOT REFLECTED HERE !!!
Full basic buffs item grants a combined 65% bonus movement speed, while in Calamity, the buffs would give 25% movement speed.

WIP:
For the most part, the actual content of the mod is finalized.
I will do my best to upkeep Hoho, but I'm fairly busy now, and don't play Terraria very much anymore. Please let me know on the workshop page if something isn't working, or if stat/balance changes are made (in vanilla).
I might eventually add a more intuitive and accessible effect toggle menu when I figure out how to use UI elements and if you guys ask for it. For now it will be in the Mod Configuration Settings.

Infinitybott and Hoho are very cool.
Thanks for coming!
This Mod is open source.
